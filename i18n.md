This app uses [`react-i18next`](react.i18next.com) for internationalisation. Configuration is in `i18n/i18n.ts`.

Translation files are organised by feature, with a `common.json` file used to cover text and terminology that does not belong to one specific feature. Depending on how full these files get, we could consider splitting files into (e.g.) `common_forms`, `common_modals`, etc.

In order to minimise typos in translation keys, we've opted to strongly type `react-i18next`, which means there is a small amount of boilerplate code required to extend the existing interface when adding a new resource file. You can see how this is done by looking at the `d.ts` file in the `i18n` folder.

Documentation for these libraries is generally excellent, but a very quick usage overview:

1. Add key in relevant `.json` namespace file under `/public/locales`. If creating a new namespace file, add to `react-i18n.d.ts` to prevent typescript compiler errors.
2. In your component, use the `useTranslation` hook, passing an array of namespaces:
   ```typescript
   const { t } = useTranslation();
   ```
3. Use the key in your jsx:
   ```jsx
   <h1>{t("common:yourNewKey")}</h1>
   ```
