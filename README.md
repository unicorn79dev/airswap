## Intro

First, please give this repo a star ‚≠êÔ∏è!

If you are interested in [AirSwap](https://www.airswap.io/) or applied Ethereum development, check out our [Discord](http://chat.airswap.io/).

## Who‚Äç

It's dangerous to go alone, take this!

- [AirSwap](https://www.airswap.io/) is a decentralized network for trading digital assets: a novel design that protects traders from [counterparty risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/counterpartyrisk.asp), [price slippage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp#:~:text=Slippage%20refers%20to%20the%20difference,when%20market%20orders%20are%20used), and [front running](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/#front-running).

- It is the weapon of choice for traditional market makers entering the decentralized financial system. With its focus on peer-to-peer, AirSwap is the de facto standard for [RFQ ("request for quote")](https://www.airswap.io/whitepaper.htm) and [OTC ("over the counter") style trading](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_(finance)>).

- AirSwap is an [open project and community](https://community.airswap.io/) collaborating on network development with participants earning protocol fees for their contributions.

## What

Through our decentralized governance process, our community approved [AIP-30](https://community.airswap.io/t/aip-30-airswap-web-app/134).

It proposed to establish AirSwap as a token swapping destination. This will be accomplished by creating a refined, lean, simple and secure swapping experience using its new visual style.

Importantly, it will be built in the spirit of our ethos as an open-source project with many contributors.

This repo contains the front end code for the token swapping portal.

## Why

AirSwap is the original token swapping app. Over the years, several iterations were launched, with the current version released two years ago. While it works well, the industry has evolved, technology has improved, and open source is now the default.

## When

We are currently looking for talented developers who want to create the future of frictionless trade on Ethereum in a decentralized manner.

See our [backlog](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-web/projects/1).

We also foresee other future projects where you can contribute to.
